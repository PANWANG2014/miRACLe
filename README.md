### <a name="1">1. Introduction</a>
The strength of miRNA-mRNA interactions (MMIs) in a biological system depends on both the sequence characteristics and expression patterns of RNAs. Integrating the two features into a random contact model, we propose **miRACLe (<u>miR</u>NA <u>A</u>nalysis by a <u>C</u>ontact mode<u>L</u>)** to achieve miRNA target prediction at both individual and population levels. Evaluation by a variety of measures shows that fitting a sequence-based algorithm into the framework of miRACLe can improve its prediction power with a significant margin, and the combination of miRACLe and the cumulative weighted context++ scores from TargetScan consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, regulatory potential and biological relevance.Empirical test suggests that on a laptop Intel Core i7-4712HQ personal computer with a 2.30 GHz CPU and 16 GB of RAM, our source code implementation requires less than 10 seconds of CPU time to complete the prediction for an individual sample.<br>

### <a name="2">2. Executing miRACLe</a>
####  <a name="3">2.1 Files required</a>
In order to run the current version of miRACLe, the users should provide two data files that describe the expression levels of each miRNA and mRNA for the same sample. And one additional file that defines the correspondence of samples between the miRNA and mRNA data files. All files are tab-delimited ASCII text files and must comply with the following specifications:

1. **Input miRNA expression file** is organized as follows:<br>

	| miRNA | TCGA-05-4384-01A-01T-1754-13 | TCGA-05-4390-01A-02T-1754-13 | TCGA-05-4396-01A-21H-1857-13 | TCGA-50-5066-01A-01T-1627-13|
	| :-------------: |:-------------:| :-----:| :-----:|:-----:|
	| hsa-let-7a-5p | 19.0144 | 16.2421 | 19.2817 | 18.0721 |
	| hsa-let-7a-3p | 7.31298 | 6.2094 | 7.8392 | 6.2667|
	| hsa-let-7a-2-3p | 6.5235 | 5.4594 | 3.7004 | 7.3837 |
	| hsa-let-7b-5p | 16.9613 | 15.5496 | 17.8444 | 16.9950 |
	| hsa-let-7b-3p | 7.9248 | 5.2094 | 7.6653 | 6.8201 |

	The first line contains the labels Name followed by the identifiers for each sample in the dataset. <br>
	>Line format: `Name(tab)(sample 1 name)(tab)(sample 2 name) (tab) ... (sample N name)`<br>
	>Example: `miRNAName	sample_1	sample_2	...	sample_n`<br>

	The remainder of the file contains data for each of the miRNAs. There is one line for each miRNA. Each line contains the miRNA name and a value for each sample in the dataset.<br>

2. **Input mRNA expression file** is organized as follows:<br>

	| Gene | TCGA-05-4384-01 | TCGA-05-4390-01 | TCGA-05-4396-01 | TCGA-50-5066-01|
	| :-------------: |:-------------:| :-----:| :-----:|:-----:|
	| AARS | 10.7094 | 11.6932 | 12.4282 | 11.0464 |
	| AASDHPPT | 9.9081 | 9.6716 | 10.1113 | 9.98328 |
	| AASDH | 7.9471 | 7.2897 | 8.3216 | 7.6274 |
	| AASS | 9.9649 | 7.7752 | 9.1723 | 5.9506 |
	| AATF | 9.9525 | 9.5380 | 9.3670 | 8.4375 |

	The first line contains the labels Name followed by the identifiers for each sample in the dataset. <br>
	>Line format: `Name(tab)(sample 1 name)(tab)(sample 2 name) (tab) ... (sample N name)`<br>
	>Example: `GeneName	sample_a	sample_b	...	sample_m`<br>

	The remainder of the file contains data for each of the mRNAs. There is one line for each mRNA. Each line contains the mRNA name and a value for each sample in the dataset.<br>

    **Note that** the input miRNA/mRNA expression file should be transformed into a non-negative matrix, in order for the main program to execute correctly. Both microarray profiling and RNA sequencing data are accepted as input. To achieve optimal prediction on the sequencing data, we strongly recommend that users provide log2 transformed normalized counts (e.g. RSEM or RPM) as the input for our program.

3. **Sample matching file** generally contains two columns, which shows the corresponding relationship of the sample identifiers in miRNA expression file and mRNA expression file (miRNA must be the first column and mRNA must be the second column). It also serves as a index to denote which samples we choose to analyze. It is organized as follows:<br>

	| miRNA | Gene | 
	| :-------------: |:-------------:| 
	| TCGA-50-5066-01A-01T-1627-13 | TCGA-50-5066-01 |
	| TCGA-05-4384-01A-01T-1754-13 | TCGA-05-4384-01 |
	| TCGA-05-4390-01A-02T-1754-13 | TCGA-05-4390-01 |
	| TCGA-05-4396-01A-21H-1857-13 | TCGA-05-4396-01 |

	The first line must contain the label Names for samples in each expression dataset with the first column for miRNA and second column for mRNA. <br>
	>Line format: `(sample name in miRNA file)(tab)(sample name in mRNA file)`<br>
	>Example: `sample_1	sample_a`<br>

	The remainder of the file contains sample identifiers used in the miRNA and mRNA expression files. There is one line for each sample. Each line contains the identifiers for that sample.<br>

#### <a name="4">2.2 Script Execution</a><br>
miRACLe is written in R and can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/PANWANG2014/miRACLe-Research/tree/master/Run%20miRACLe) along with test datasets. The source code of miRACLe consists of three parts, namely, 'FUNCTIONS', 'DATA INPUT' and 'MAIN CODE'. The main function "miracle" in "MAIN PROGRAM" calculates the miracle score for each miRNA-mRNA pair at individual and population levels, based on which all putative MMIs are ranked. The essential inputs that the miRACLe algorithm requires to run includes two parts:<br>

The first part contains the sequence-based interaction scores (`seqScore`) for putative miRNA-mRNA pairs. These scores are originally obtained from TargetSan v7.2 (TargetScan7\_CWCS\_cons and TargetScan7\_CWCS), DIANA-microT-CDS (DIANA\_microT\_CDS), MirTarget v4 (MirTarget4), miRanda-mirSVR (miRanda\_mirSVR) and compiled by the developers to fit the model. Default is **TargetScan7\_CWCS\_cons**. The other scores can be downloaded [here](https://figshare.com/s/0b7c68cd5152da27a191).<br>
	
```r
seqScore = as.matrix(read.table("TargetScan7_CWCS_cons.txt", head = TRUE, sep = "\t"))
```

User can also provide their own sequence matching scores, as long as the format of input file meets the requirements. Specifically, the first line must contain the label Names for mRNAs, miRNAs and their associated interaction scores. The remainder of the file contains RNA identifiers corresponding to those used in the expression files and the scores for each miRNA-mRNA pair. Note that the first column must contain identifiers for mRNAs, the second column must contain identifiers for miRNAs with the third column containing the associated scores.<br>

The second part contains paired miRNA-mRNA expression profiles and should be provided by the users. 

```r
sampleMatch = as.matrix(read.table("Test_DLBC_sampleMatch.txt", head = TRUE, sep = "\t"))
mirExpr = as.matrix(read.table("Test_DLBC_miRNA.txt", head = FALSE, sep = "\t"))
tarExpr = as.matrix(read.table("Test_DLBC_mRNA.txt", head = FALSE, sep = "\t"))
```	

The 'miracle' function also provides three optional parameters for users, which are: `samSelect` (sample selection, users can select a subset of all samples to analyze, default is NULL, which means no selection will applied), `exprFilter` (filter of expression profile, miRNAs/mRNAs that are not expressed in more than a given percentage of samples will be removed, default is 1),  and `OutputSelect` (logical variable, select “TRUE” to return the top 10 percent-ranked predictions by scores, and “FALSE” to return the whole prediction result. Default is TRUE).

```r
miracle(seqScore, sampleMatch, mirExpr, tarExpr, samSelect = NULL, exprFilter = 1, OutputSelect = TRUE)
```

### <a name="6">3. Benchmarking evaluations</a><br>
